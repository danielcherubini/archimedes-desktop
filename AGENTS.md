# AGENTS.md

Archimedes Desktop — a cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux) Tauri 2 app
that connects to coding agents. The Rust core speaks pi's RPC mode natively
(`pi --mode rpc` — JSONL over stdio; ADR 0009). Rust backend (`src-tauri/`)
+ React 19 / TypeScript frontend (`src/`). See `CONTEXT.md` for terminology
and `docs/decisions/` for ADRs.

## Build & Testing

Validation runs from two roots — the frontend from the repo root, the Rust
backend from `src-tauri/`. A branch is ready to merge when all of these are
green:

| What | Command | Where |
|------|---------|-------|
| Frontend unit tests | `pnpm test` | repo root |
| Frontend type-check + build | `pnpm build` | repo root |
| Rust tests | `cargo test` | `src-tauri/` |
| Rust lint | `cargo clippy --all-targets` | `src-tauri/` (must be 0 warnings) |
| Rust formatting | `cargo fmt --check` | `src-tauri/` |

The `pi-archimedes` monorepo (the agent-side extension suite, a separate repo)
is validated with `pnpm test` + `pnpm -r exec -- tsc --noEmit` from its root.

## Conventions

- **TDD**: write the failing test first, confirm it fails, then make it pass.
- **Squash-merge** feature branches into `main` (one commit per feature).
- **Docs**: durable design decisions live in `docs/decisions/NNNN-slug.md`
  (ADR format); in-flight plans live in `docs/roadmap/<feature>.md` and are
  deleted on ship.
- The desktop is the **Client** of the bridge channel; `pi-archimedes` is the
  **Agent** side. The bridge is env-gated and inert without the
  `PI_ARCHIMEDES_BRIDGE_*` env vars (see `docs/decisions/0003-bridge-client.md`).
